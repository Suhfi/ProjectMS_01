# A project with microservices architecture
In this project I have build independent services with indepentdent databases and have build a connection between them throung Rest APIs. Contains the details about different schools and the students associated with them. The microservices are connected to a Discovery-Server ,  all these microservices get the configuration from a centralized Config-Server. In this project I have used Zipkin to trace the logs of different services. I have also build an API-Gateway to handle requests.
